## Game planning

This is a simple TicTacToe game. I used GET method to submit user input because it was easier to debug it. Also I used POST for Reset button.
I chose Design C as a main form processing flow since it allows user to submit form multiple times and "stays" on the same page all the time.

+ Create a board by using *for* loop

## Notes for instructor
After the first project I installed Xdebug on my server and configured it in VS code. However, I still cannot understand how to use breakpoints when navigating in the browser. Console debugging works Ok but it is not enough when you need to debug user inputs. It would be great to have some tutorial on this topic.
